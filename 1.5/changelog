Version 1.5 - Jan 29, 2013 18:49

- removed Array.num prototype; it is never used
- replaced checkUndefined with checkArgs and argsToArr which makes the call more beautiful: checkUndefined("add(z, w)", ["z", "w"], [z, w]); -> checkArgs("add(z, w, nprec)", arguments);
- systematized treatment of nprec in the complex functions with getNprec and checkArgs
- div checks when c and d are 0
- reordered complex functions: add, mult, div, exp, ln, pow, root, sqrt, cbrt, abs, arg, sgn, sin, cos, round, trunc, floor, ceil, re, im, conj
- exp: applied multiplication accuracy formula
- pow uses powr for whenever z and w are real and either w is an integer or z is positive instead of just when w is an integer
- root: use real functions when z is real and n is odd
- sin and cos: applied multiplication accuracy formula
- added re, im, and conj functions
- moved negr to real functions group
- powr uses multr when b = 2 and uses exp(b*ln(a)) when b isn't an integer
