Perfectly Precise Math Library 4.0 - Jul 15, 2014 14:38

- split complex number functions to cmpl-math
- a lot of renames including
    isInt -> intp
    isEven -> evnp
    padZeros -> pad
    isDiffZero -> diff
    len -> siz
    mDotLeft -> left
    remDec -> remdot
    mult -> mul
    round -> rnd
    quotAndRem -> qar
    genContFrac -> frac
- simplified expr
- new powDec formula 10x faster; improves speed of exp a lot as well (try exp(900, 1000))
- logging system moved from complex-math
