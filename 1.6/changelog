Version 1.6 - Feb 18, 2013 12:11

- new complex functions sinh, cosh
- replaced a.replace("-", "") with remNeg(a)
- replaced a.indexOf(".") != -1 with isDec(a)
- replaced a.replace(".", "") with remDot(a)
- mDotRight and mDotLeft: replaced substr with substring
- all remNegs are checked with isNeg
- rewrote sign part of multr and divr
- rewrote isZero
- replaced some !isInt with isDec
- implemented Karatsuba multiplication
- powr: fixed coding error
- expr: improved speed by adding taylor series with large fraction
- roundr: replaced a += 0 with a += "0"
- sinr, cosr: improved speed by adding taylor series with large fraction
- sinr, cosr: replaced var pi = pir(nprec+1+len(divr(a, 5, 0))); with var pi = pir(nprec+3+len(a));
- sinr, cosr: removed extraneous round at end and set precision for sin and cossmall to nprec instead of nprec+1
- sinr, cosr: replaced subr(a, addr(hPI, hPI)); with subr(a, pi);
- sinsmall, cossmall: replaced multr(i, i-1) with i*(i-1); the numbers are small enough to use native mult
- padZeros now for 2, 345 returns 002, 345 instead of 002.0, 345.0
- improved speed of trimZeros
