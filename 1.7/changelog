- rewrote divr algorithm
- sqrtrd: fixed precision bug
- lnr: new faster algorithm with machin-like formulas for ln2, ln5, ln10
- floorr, ceilr, truncr: added trimZeros when there is no dot
- sinsmall, cossmall: only calculate a^2 when a is an integer
- atan2r: only calculate pi and hPI when necessary
- acotrl, acothrl: continued fractions used for calculating ln2, 5, and 10 and pi
- pir: new algorithm using Machin-like formulas
